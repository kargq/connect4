Setup/Installation
==================

executable file is main.py, the project is written in python3

The dependencies for the project are listed in requirements.txt, use pip to install dependencies.

Theres two scripts included:

1. install_requirements.sh
Creates a python virtual environment and installs dependencies inside the enviornment.

2. run.sh
Runs the program assuming a virtual environment is set up.

Another option is to just do pip install -r requirements.txt, the requirements are just numpy and pygame.

Yet another option for windows is cd to dist/main and run main.exe. I used a tool called pyintaller to build this executeable.

Execution
==========

After running main.py, the program will prompt you to select game mode, either PvP or vs AI

If selecting ai, program will ask who should go first, user or ai

The gui for the game, a pygame window will then pop up.

The gui updates on click, (Click to update if just a black screen is visible in the pygame window)

Click to select column, the column is highlighted indicating that it is selected.

Click a selected column to place a piece.

The display updates with your move after the ai is done executing. This can take long depending on what ply you specified.
